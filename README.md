# ATP Dataset

- This is a growing project. So far it is composed of
  - `get_stats.py`, a function for getting the statistics from the ATP World Tour web site - the `Overview` and `Player-Stats` pages.
  - `save_stats.py` to save the data obtained with `get_stats.py` in a `json` file.
  - `atp_study.py`, an initial study of the ATP dataset.

- All of the `.py` files were first created using the `atp.ipynb` and `Study ATP.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks.
